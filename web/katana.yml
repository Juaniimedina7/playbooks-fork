  description: "Katana is a web crawling and spidering tool that supports headless browsing, JavaScript execution, automatic form filling, and regex-based scope control. It processes input from standard input, URLs, or file lists and outputs to standard output, files, or JSON. Passive crawling from external sources has been moved to a separate tool called URLFinder."
