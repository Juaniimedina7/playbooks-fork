  description: "DIRB is a command-line web content scanner that performs dictionary-based attacks to discover hidden directories and files on web servers. It works by systematically requesting URLs from a provided wordlist and analyzing the serverâ€™s HTTP responses to identify existing or hidden web objects. DIRB comes with preconfigured wordlists but also allows the use of custom lists."
