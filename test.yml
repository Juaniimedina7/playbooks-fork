  name: Hello World Test
  description: "This playbook is designed to test the output of two commands to ensure it contains the phrase **Hello World**. It defines a parent test named `test`, which includes an assertion on two echoes. The assertion, `assertStdoutContains: Hello World`, checks that the standard output from the executed commands contains the string **Hello World**.\n\nThe playbook defines two command blocks: `hello` and `whatever`. The `hello` block executes the command `echo Hello World`, which prints **Hello World**. Similarly, the `whatever` block executes the command `echo ${{INPUT}}`, which prints whatever the value of the `INPUT` variable is.\n\nFor example, if `INPUT` is set to **Hello World**, the commands will again output *Hello World* and the parent assertion will pass."
